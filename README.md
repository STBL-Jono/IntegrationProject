This is Jonathan Farkas' Integration Project

This project features a playable maze game with fog-of-war functionality.

This project was made when I was a college freshman with limited previous coding experience for our Integration Project in Introduction to Computer Science.

This project was mostly made at home, though I would occasionally code in class when ideas presented themselves.
